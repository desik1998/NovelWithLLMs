<STORY TILL NOW>

Continue with the next para. Just continue with 1 more event which happens next in the para. This event sure follow these:

1. The amount of information in that event should be accurate as possible considering the historic nature of each of the founding fathers, their nature, beliefs, their morals for their time, their knowledge for their time, their diverse views on topics

2. The event should be gripping for the reader

3. Keep the event as real as possible. Like the reader should feel like this can really happen like the Founding Fathers 18th Century English, their perceptions about things etc

4. Make sure that you avoid repeating something from the story until now

5. The new event should be in a way that the reader should feel the story in a continuous

6. Add human emotions and a little drama to the event

8. Avoid missing details in the event and instead emphasize on the details

9. Bring a sense of curiousness amongst the characters in the story i.e. them asking questions, paying attention to detail etc

10. Keep in mind that the new event which you generate shouldn't be similar to the existing events in the current story. This is of the Highest priority

11. Avoid the same style used in the previous events as it can might not keep the story reader gripped when reading

15. When you genenate the next event, avoid rushing through it and instead focus on the details

16. **Make sure that the event you generate aligns with the current chapter, the event is a continuation of the past events / past chapters and the event aligns and takes us to the future chapters**

18. The characters in the story should have high curiosity of why things are happening and they've a high sense of questioning things

19. Avoid rushing from event to event by skipping details. Make sure that the event is filled with details without abstraction. Again this is a long story so keep the details in each event. The event you write down should make sure the story is going one step at a time instead of being rushed over

Sure! I will continue the story from where it was left off, following the guidelines provided.
