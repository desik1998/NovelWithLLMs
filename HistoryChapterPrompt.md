As the current chapter is all about explaining history since the time of founders, don't jump too fast into every historic event, instead describe each historic event in great detail **year by year** so that the founders can make sense of it. Additionally, the founders should be super curious and also be questioning what events happened, what didn't certain happen, the why part behind everything. When mentioning the event, also mention the year so that the founders are aware where the story is going. Go year-by-year so that the founding fathers would make sense of things. Now continue from where the story is left
